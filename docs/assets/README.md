## Supplied Assets

Admon provides a complete GUI for administrators, making it easy to administer the site's content in a cohesive and user-friendly manner. The following components are provided:


### [DynamicTable](components/DynamicTable.md)

Easily build tables which your users can add to, and remove from. Works well when combined with [Sortable](components/Sortable.md).


### [Sortable](components/Sortable.md)

Allows you to build sortable components for your administrator users.


### [Searcher](components/Searcher.md)

Provides a simple API for building dynamic dropdowns which allow you to search for additional content.



## Autoloading Assets in Admin

It is easy for the application (or any installed module) to automatically load assets into the admin interface.
